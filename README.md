# SwiftCalculator
Swift - Basic Calculator App

App created in Xcode 10.2.1 (10E1001) using Swift 4.2, iOS Deployment Target 12.2 and tested on a iPhone Xr Emulator

This is a simple basic calculator app you could use on your iOS device. All a user needs to do is just click on the 
'Swift Calc' icon and they are taken right into the app. The first thing you see is a dark grey background. Then on top
is your calculator digit window where the numbers pressed will be displayed. Right below is your key pad with its basic
calculator options, Keys from 0-9, math operators +, -, *, / with an equal key and a 'C' key which clears the display.

Details and the screen cap images of the app in use can be found on <a href="http://digitalmirko.com/iOSApps.html">Digital Mirko</a>.
